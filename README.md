# LeapCamera_for_drone_control
To use this project on Linux (created on Ubuntu 20.4) you need to install:

-[Leap Motion SDK V 2.3.1](https://docs.ultraleap.com/linux/) (here you find the installation guide). This is the API to interface with the Leap Camera

-[openCV](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)

-[pyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

You can find the complete API documentation at [C++ SDK Documentation](https://developer-archive.leapmotion.com/documentation/cpp/index.html?proglang=cpp)

Once the setup is done, you can build the Main.cpp and start recording data.
